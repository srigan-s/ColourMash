## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and frontend development.  
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed language for safer, more maintainable code.  
- **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` for state and DOM handling.  
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Styling, layout, and animations.  
- **Camera API**: `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` for real-time video capture.  
- **Canvas API**: Detects dominant color of user cards using image data processing.  
- **Tailwind CSS (optional)**: Utility-first styling for responsive and interactive components.

## How It Works
1. The user starts the game and chooses a mode.  
2. A sequence of colors is generated and flashed on screen.  
3. The user holds colored cards up to the camera to repeat the sequence.  
4. The app detects the colors via the camera, verifies the sequence, and updates the score.  
5. Feedback is displayed in a modal for success (`win`) or retry (`lose`).
